Well, I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
I know it&#x27;s crazy and I don&#x27;t know why
But I die just a little bit
(Die just a little bit)
I need to be the one by your side
You&#x27;re the beat in my heart
My love for you is something I can&#x27;t hide
And I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
Every night before I&#x27;m fall into sleep
Well, I pray just a little bit
(Pray just a little bit)
I&#x27;m praying about you that your love is complete
When you stay just a little bit
(Stay just a little bit)
Don&#x27;t let the strangers fill your heart with dreams
Don&#x27;t let your mind run away
Far be it love is never what it seems
And you cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
Cry just a little bit, little bit
You&#x27;re the luck that brightens all of my days
And the sun shines above you
And I would die of someone took you away
Cause I love you, love you
I want forever to be you and I
And that&#x27;s the way it should be
I live for you and baby
That is why I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
I cry just a little bit
Everytime you have to whisper goodbye
Well I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
I know it&#x27;s crazy and I don&#x27;t know why
But I die just a little bit
(Die just a little bit)
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit.
