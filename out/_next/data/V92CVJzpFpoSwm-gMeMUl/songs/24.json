X2\n\n\nHoliday in Paris\nSunday afternoon\nMeeting a french girl\nEv'ning walk by moon\nSo we were dancing on the music\nAnd I was waiting for my chance\nI only didn't understand her\nWhen she said in french.\n\nComment ça va\nComme ci, comme ci, comme ci, comme ça\nTu ne comprends rien à l'amour\nRestez la nuit, restez toujours.       X2\n\n\nFell in love in Paris\nDidn't know what to do\nWalking with my girl\nRendez-vous for two\nI was afraid to kiss my baby\nDidn't know what she'd say\nDrinking wine by evening\nIn a small café.\n\n\nI ask her to kiss me\nAsked for something more\nShe didn't understand me\nLike I didn't before.\n\nComment ça va\nComme ci, comme ci, comme ci, comme ça\nTu ne comprends rien à l'amour\nRestez la nuit, restez toujours.
