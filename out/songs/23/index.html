As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I&#x27;m never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it&#x27;s easy to pretend
I know you&#x27;re not a fool

Should&#x27;ve known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I&#x27;d been given
So I&#x27;m never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There&#x27;s no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you&#x27;ll find

I&#x27;m never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it&#x27;s easy to pretend
I know you&#x27;re not a fool

I should&#x27;ve known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I&#x27;d been given
So I&#x27;m never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ohh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it&#x27;s better this way
We&#x27;d hurt each other with the things we&#x27;d want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one&#x27;s gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I&#x27;m never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it&#x27;s easy to pretend
I know you&#x27;re not a fool

Should&#x27;ve known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I&#x27;d been given
So I&#x27;m never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Now that you&#x27;re gone
(Now that you&#x27;re gone) Was what I did&#x27;s so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?</div></div></div><div class="Footer_wrapper__oXaEJ">Copyright @DBer <!-- -->2021</div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"song":{"__typename":"SongEntity","id":"23","attributes":{"__typename":"Song","title":"Careless whisper","lyrics":"I feel so unsure\nAs I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor\nAs the music dies, something in your eyes\nCalls to mind a silver screen\nAnd all its sad good-byes\n\nI'm never gonna dance again\nGuilty feet have got no rhythm\nThough it's easy to pretend\nI know you're not a fool\n\nShould've known better than to cheat a friend\nAnd waste the chance that I'd been given\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\nThe way I danced with you\n\nTime can never mend\nThe careless whispers of a good friend\nTo the heart and mind\nIgnorance is kind\nThere's no comfort in the truth\nPain is all you'll find\n\nI'm never gonna dance again\nGuilty feet have got no rhythm\nThough it's easy to pretend\nI know you're not a fool\n\nI should've known better than to cheat a friend\nAnd waste the chance that I'd been given\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\nThe way I danced with you, ohh\n\nNever without your love\n\nTonight the music seems so loud\nI wish that we could lose this crowd\nMaybe it's better this way\nWe'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say\n\nWe could have been so good together\nWe could have lived this dance forever\nBut no one's gonna dance with me\nPlease stay\n\nAnd I'm never gonna dance again\nGuilty feet have got no rhythm\nThough it's easy to pretend\nI know you're not a fool\n\nShould've known better than to cheat a friend\nAnd waste the chance that I'd been given\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\nThe way I danced with you\n\nNow that you're gone\n(Now that you're gone) Was what I did's so wrong, so wrong\nThat you had to leave me alone?","artist":{"__typename":"ArtistEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"ArtistEntity","id":"9","attributes":{"__typename":"Artist","name":"George Michael"}}},"genre":{"__typename":"GenreEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"GenreEntity","id":"6","attributes":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Wolne zagraniczne"}}}}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/songs/[songId]","query":{"songId":"23"},"buildId":"wzt5sHYRK6lA6qpy06pMt","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
