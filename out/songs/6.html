If you love me truly
If you want me, Julie
To be, to be your very own?
Julie, love me only
Julie, don&#x27;t be lonely
&#x27;Cause I want you only
To be, to be my very own
Ooh, Baby, don&#x27;t leave me
Honey, don&#x27;t grieve me
Julie, why leave me alone?
Stay with me, baby
Lay with me maybe
Honey, don&#x27;t leave me alone!
Julie, never leave me
Please, don&#x27;t deceive me!
Julie, oh, believe me
And be, and be my very own ...

Whoa, whoa, Julie
