I see a love that money just can&#x27;t buy

One look from you I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby

Every time I hold you I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I&#x27;m your man

I live (I live)
My life (My life)
To be (To be)
With you (With you)
No one (No one)
Can do (Can do)
The things (The things)
You do (You do)

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby

Anything you want (You got it)
Anything you need (You got it)
Anything at all

Do-do-do-do-doo (Oh)
Do-do-do-do-doo (Oh yeah)
Do-do-do-do-doo (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(You got it)

I&#x27;m glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby

Anything at all (You got it)
Baby
