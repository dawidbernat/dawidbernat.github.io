I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man, &#x27;cause you&#x27;re in a new town
There&#x27;s no need to be unhappy

Young man, there&#x27;s a place you can go
I said, young man, when you&#x27;re short on your dough
You can stay there, and I&#x27;m sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA
It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA

They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys

It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA
It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do what ever you feel

Young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you want to be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams
But you got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf
And just go there, to the YMCA
I&#x27;m sure they can help you today

It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA
It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA

They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys

It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA
It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do what ever you feel

Young man, I was once in your shoes
I said, I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so tight

That&#x27;s when someone came up to me
And said, young man, take a walk up the street
There&#x27;s a place there called the YMCA
They can start you back on your way

It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA
It&#x27;s fun to stay at the YMCA

They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys</div></div></div><div class="Footer_wrapper__oXaEJ">Copyright @DBer <!-- -->2021</div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"song":{"__typename":"SongEntity","id":"9","attributes":{"__typename":"Song","title":"YMCA","lyrics":"Young man, there's no need to feel down\nI said, young man, pick yourself off the ground\nI said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town\nThere's no need to be unhappy\n\nYoung man, there's a place you can go\nI said, young man, when you're short on your dough\nYou can stay there, and I'm sure you will find\nMany ways to have a good time\n\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\n\nThey have everything for you men to enjoy\nYou can hang out with all the boys\n\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\n\nYou can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal\nYou can do what ever you feel\n\nYoung man, are you listening to me?\nI said, young man, what do you want to be?\nI said, young man, you can make real your dreams\nBut you got to know this one thing\nNo man does it all by himself\nI said, young man, put your pride on the shelf\nAnd just go there, to the YMCA\nI'm sure they can help you today\n\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\n\nThey have everything for you men to enjoy\nYou can hang out with all the boys\n\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\n\nYou can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal\nYou can do what ever you feel\n\nYoung man, I was once in your shoes\nI said, I was down and out with the blues\nI felt no man cared if I were alive\nI felt the whole world was so tight\n\nThat's when someone came up to me\nAnd said, young man, take a walk up the street\nThere's a place there called the YMCA\nThey can start you back on your way\n\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\nIt's fun to stay at the YMCA\n\nThey have everything for you men to enjoy\nYou can hang out with all the boys","artist":{"__typename":"ArtistEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"ArtistEntity","id":"7","attributes":{"__typename":"Artist","name":"Inny"}}},"genre":{"__typename":"GenreEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"GenreEntity","id":"7","attributes":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Szybkie zagraniczne"}}}}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/songs/[songId]","query":{"songId":"9"},"buildId":"wzt5sHYRK6lA6qpy06pMt","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
